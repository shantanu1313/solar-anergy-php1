      <h1>Why Solar is the Future of India</h1>
      <p class="date">📅 30 January, 2025</p>

      <p>
        India is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in solar energy due
        to its high solar radiation levels, large land availability, and increasing
        focus on renewable energy development.

      <h3>☀️ Abundant Solar Potential</h3>
      <p>
        Most regions in India, including Ahilyanagar, receive ample sunlight
        throughout the year, making solar energy a reliable and cost-effective
        power source for homes and businesses.

      <h3>🏛️ Government Policies & Support</h3>
      <p>
        Government initiatives such as subsidies, net metering, and national solar
        missions have accelerated solar adoption across residential, commercial,
        and industrial sectors.
      </p>

      <h3>⚡ Economic & Environmental Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Solar energy reduces dependence on fossil fuels, lowers carbon emissions,
        creates employment opportunities, and supports long-term economic growth
        while protecting the environment.

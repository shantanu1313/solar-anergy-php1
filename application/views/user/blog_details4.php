      <h1>Solar Energy vs Traditional Energy</h1>
      <p class="date">📅 28 January, 2025</p>

      <p>
        As energy demands continue to rise, many homes and businesses in Ahilyanagar
        are comparing solar energy with traditional power sources to find reliable
        and cost-effective solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>☀️ Solar Energy – Clean & Renewable</h3>
      <p>
        Solar energy is a renewable source of power that produces electricity without
        harmful emissions. It helps reduce pollution, lowers electricity bills, and
        supports long-term energy sustainability.
      </p>

      <h3>🔥 Traditional Energy – Limited & Polluting</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional energy sources such as coal, oil, and gas are limited in supply
        and contribute significantly to air pollution and climate change. Rising fuel
        costs also make them less economical over time.
      </p>

      <h3>⚡ Cost & Energy Independence</h3>
      <p>
        Solar energy allows users to generate their own electricity, reducing dependency
        on the grid and protecting against frequent power tariff increases.
